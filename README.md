# Code-Quiz

The task was to create a Quiz to practica coding concepts using Javascript CSS and HTML.

I had the idea to make a Quiz webpage in which I could easily expand or exchange the content of the questions and answer in case I wanted to use the code in later projects. So I decided to choose another topic besides coding to practice this idea. That topic also helped me later to decide how i wanted the webpage to look and feel.

First I created the HTML structure using a couple of sections that will display or hide depending on the stage of the game. Then I started to work on the Javascript file by creating the arrays of objects I was going to use for the questions.
