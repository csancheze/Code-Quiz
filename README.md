Code Quiz is web based application of a game in which you have a limited time to answer correctly and get the highest score.

The task was to create a Quiz  Game to practice coding concepts using DOM APIs, Javascript, CSS and HTML.

I had the idea to make a Quiz webpage in which I could easily expand or exchange the content of the questions and answers in case I wanted to use the code in later projects. So I decided to choose another topic besides coding to practice this idea. That topic also helped me later to decide how i wanted the webpage to look and feel.

First I created the HTML structure using a couple of sections that will display or hide depending on the stage of the game. Then I started to work on the Javascript file by creating the arrays of objects I was going to use for the questions and answers. After coding that and the main variables I was going to use, I started with the functions for the timer and the game itself. When I was done, the rest of the time was adjusting bugs and making sure everything worked. Finally, I worked on the css for the format until everything was done. The rest of the time was spent on fixing bugs and adjusting the UI.
